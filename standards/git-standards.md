# Git Project Standards

## Branches :

Branch names should start by addressing the milestone of the project that was worked on followed by the issue name between hyphens, as for example:
```
    v0.1-update-documentation
```

## Pull Requests :
Pull requests should specify which issue its trying to solve, how is it solved and which tests are implemented to test the new/changed functionalities.

## Commits :
Commit title should clearly explain what has been done and it should have the PullRequest number on it.

## Issues :
Issues should have a descriptive title that briefly summarizes it and uses keywords relevant to the problem.
When the issue arrises from existing code (bug) it should include:
- Steps to reproduce the behavior (if applicable)
- Expected behavior vs. actual behavior
- Screenshots (if helpful)
- Relevant error messages or logs

Otherwise, when the issue tries to solve a problem that needs new code devolpment it should:
- Clearly describe the specific problem or gap in functionality. 
- Explain why it's important to address the issue and the impact it has on project goals.
- Outline a proposal for a new feature or functionality. This doesn't need to be a detailed design document, but a high-level overview of what the new code would accomplish and how it would address the problem.
- Alternatives (optional): If alternative solutions have been considered, briefly mention them and explain why these proposed solution is preferable.
