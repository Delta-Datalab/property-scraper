# Code Standards

## Docstrings:
Method docstrings should follow the structure of explaining what the method does and what it returns, as for example:
```
    """Get price of the property.

    Returns:
        The price of the property.
    """
```

For all other docstring types, the [PEP 257 guidelines]( https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/) should be followed.

## Tests:
Test names should be written in mixedCase and started with the word test.
	

## Variables and Methods:
Variable and method names should be written in mixedCase and the [PEP 8 guidelines]( https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#global-variable-names) should be followed.
	

## Formatting : 
Format shoud follow the [PEP 8 guidelines]( https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) and use [Black]( https://github.com/psf/black), in its default specifications, as an auto formatter.
